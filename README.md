## Description
This image contains naps (NGINX auth proxy system). It provides an easy way to create an openid connect auth proxy.

## Tags
We do NOT push a `latest` tag for this image. You should always pin a specific version for it.
We do not follow the aws-es-proxy release tags in the docker image tags. You can always find the aws-es-proxy version in the Dockerfile that was used to create the image or you can use the labels.

#### *Note*
We do publish a `master` tag which is based on the master branch. This should only be used for testing purposes and never for actual deployments.
